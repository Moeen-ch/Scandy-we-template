When it comes to online shopping, few verticals have seen demand as high as the fashion industry. Our penchant for buying clothes and accessories online has caused the fashion ecommerce market to skyrocket to <a href="#"> nearly $500 billion </a> in revenue in 2018, with <a href="#"> 57% of internet </a> users worldwide having purchased clothing online. 

                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5 scandy-pro-para">
                            Yet, these numbers don’t show the full scope of the substantial changes occurring within the fashion market. Growing concerns around sustainability have led fast-fashion retailers like Zara, H&M, and Forever 21 to close stores or even <a href="#">declare bankruptcy,</a> in the case of Forever 21. This all happened prior to the coronavirus outbreak, which caused online clothing sales to <a href="#"> drop 34% </a> due to shifting consumer needs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5 scandy-pro-para">
                            All of this adds up to what one BBC journalist called an <a href="#"> ‘existential crisis’</a> for the fashion industry. People won’t stop buying clothing any time soon - what will change, however, is the way in which they shop. A focus on individuality and sustainability is something the major fashion retailers haven’t fully come to terms with yet, but the potential for 3D scanning and AR/VR technology to help meet the future of online shopping is growing as a positive trend.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5">The Right Outfit, The Right Fit
                        </h2>
                        <p class="mt-5">One of the most pressing issues for fashion ecommerce retailers lies in returns.  As much as <a href="#"> 40% </a> of online purchases are returned, compared to the in-store return rate of 5-10%. These numbers can clearly eat into a company’s bottom line.</p>
                        <p class="mt-5">
                            It’s not hard to understand why this is such an issue in ecommerce, for both companies and their customers. We’ve all had the experience of buying a shirt or a pair of pants that were advertised as being a certain size, but on arrival turned out to be far too tight or too baggy. Without being able to see, feel, and try on the clothing in person, we’re forced to make our best estimates with the written information and photos we have.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5">
                            But there’s another way to ensure proper size, one that works down to the millimeter. With a user-facing 3D scanning app, users could scan their arms, chest, legs, and other body parts to ensure the clothing they order will fit perfectly. Forward-thinking retailers could receive this information after the user sends their scanned files and then use the 3D scan and extracted measurements to deliver out the right sized outfit. The customer gets the item they want and can wear it right out of the box. Meanwhile, the retailer can rest easy knowing returns are no longer the issue they once were. It’s a simple fix to a global problem, and one that could revitalize the fashion industry’s fortunes in a post-pandemic age.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5">The Right Outfit, The Right Fit
                        </h2>
                        <p class="mt-5">
                            The only real way to reduce this issue is to ensure a proper fit before the item is shipped. In a brick and mortar retailer, salespeople use <a href="#"> Brannock devices</a> to measure a proper fit. When buying online, 3D scanning serves a similar purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5">
                            Modern iPhone apps make use of a user-facing or world-facing sensor to properly outline one’s foot from heel to toe, creating an accurate representation of the shopper’s build. This scan can then be sent to the retailer to ensure the shoes offered are the right size for every customer, thereby reducing returns while expanding sales.
                        </p>
                           
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Personalizing Your Wardrobe
                        </h2>
                        <p class="mt-5">Ensuring accuracy when selling off-the-rack items is important, but there’s another area where 3D scanning truly thrives. Most consumers don’t have the budget to shop for bespoke items, which are tailor-made to their particular body type and shape. What’s more, purchasing these items often requires multiple in-store visits for fittings and consultations, which only add to the final cost of the product.</p>
                        <p class="mt-5">
                            User-facing scanners allow individuals to take measurements of their own body in just a few minutes. If retailers choose, they can ask for necessary measurements - chest span, arm length, wrist size, and more - and use that information to make tailored items for any customer seeking a custom fit. Retailers and brands could develop workflows around extracting this necessary information from 3D scans, offering a new method of online shopping for their fashion-conscious customers.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Building A Fashion Retail Future
                        </h2>
                        <p class="mt-5">
                            The online market for bespoke products is nascent at this point due to the difficulty in ensuring accuracy. With 3D scanning, this issue becomes a thing of the past, allowing fashion shoppers to focus on a growing concern: ethical production. Fast fashion items are notorious for falling apart after a few wears, and rely on sweatshop labor to keep prices low and production high. It’s a system that amplifies inequality while adding far too much to our landfills.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
                            Bespoke fashion can be offered at a fair rate, and manufactured locally from high-quality fabric. While the price is higher than mass-manufactured clothing, these items can last for generations with proper care. It’s part of an overall trend toward unique, one-of-a-kind items in our era of ecommerce personalization.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
                            These shifts toward sustainability and personalization are by no means unique to the fashion industry. They are, however, a growing concern for shoppers across age groups and demographics. Ecommerce retailers who rise to meet the trend will see more success and greater gains into our post-pandemic future - provided they adopt the right technology needed to give consumers what they truly want.
                        </p>
